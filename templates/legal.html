    <h1>Terms and Conditions of Use of this Website</h1>
    <p>This website is in no way affiliated with the Water and Sewerage Authority
      of Trinidad and Tobago, or any other government entity. This website was made
      as part of the requirement for a Msc in geoinformatics at the University of
      the West Indies, St. Augustine campus. As such, any information obtained from
      this website cannot be considered to be accurate or reliable. Additionally,
      all data on this website was generated using a random algorithm.</p>
    <p>I would also like to cite section 5.21 of the National Integrated Water Resources
      Management Policy for the Government of Trinidad and Tobago:</p>
    <blockquote cite="http://www.mpu.gov.tt/home/files/Draft%20Revised%20National%20IWRM%20Policy_March2017.pdf">
      "5.21.2 The Freedom of Information Act establishes a high general right to access
      information in the possession of public authorities. Consistent with that Act,
      Government will support meaningful and effective public participation in water
      resources management by providing the public with timely and accurate information
      about both treated and ambient water quality and quantity."
    </blockquote>
    <p>Some people may then direct you to section 6.9 of the policy document, which reads:</p>
    <blockquote>"The Government will establish a standardised, integrated electronic water
      resources information management system for the collection, processing,
      storage, analysis, and retrieval of information to inform the decision
      making process. Basic information in the system will be vailable to the
      public at a nominal charge. More techincal and value-added information will
      attract an appropriate charge."</blockquote>

    <p>I now invite you to discuss whether these two statements agree or contradict
      each other, or any other points you would like to draw.</p>

    <p>Requests for similar data found on this website must be made through the
      Water Resources Agency, Trinidad and Tobago, by form of a letter addressed to the Head.</p>
